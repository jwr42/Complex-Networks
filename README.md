# ComplexNetworks
A repository of the python code created for my undergraduate research project.

plex.py is a python module that contains a number of functions designed to create model networks, help in the analysis of networks and help create plots of the behaviours of different networks. Functions only work on network edges that are unweighted and undirected.

HINT_import.py creates adjacency matrices of network files downloaded from the High-quality INTeractomes (HINT) website.

TCNG_import.py creates adjacency matrices of network files downloaded from The Cancer Network Galaxy (TCNG) website.
